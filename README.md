## Description

<img src="http://gruntjs.com/img/grunt-logo.png" width="100" align="right"/>

`grunt-mongo-migrations` works by keeping track of migration files that it executes in the `migrations_versions` MongoDB collection. You create and write your migrations which you then execute on your server. Migrations that were already executed will not execute again.

## Installation

    $ npm install grunt-mongo-migrations

## Tests

    $ npm test

## Usage

### Gruntfile

    module.exports = (grunt) ->
      grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-mongo-migrations'

      grunt.initConfig
        migrations:
          path: "#{__dirname}/migrations"
          template: grunt.file.read "#{__dirname}/migrations/_template.coffee" # optional
          mongo: 'mongodb://localhost:12345'
          ext: "coffee"

#### Options

##### path (required)
Type: `String`  
Path to directory containing migrations.

##### template
Type: `String`  
Template for generating new migration files.

##### mongo
Type: `String` | `Object` | `Function`  
If a string is specified, it is the connection string for MongoDB. If an object is specified, it may have two properties: `uri` (required) which is the connection string, and `opts` which will be passed through to `mongoose.createConnection`. Ex:

    grunt.initConfig
      migrations:
        path: "#{__dirname}/migrations"
        mongo:
          uri: 'mongodb://localhost:12345'
          opts:
            ssl: true
If a function is specified, it must return either a string or object as described above.

##### ext
Type: `String`  
Default: `'coffee'`  
Values: `'coffee'` | `'js'`  
Migrations file extension.

### _template.coffee

By default the task will generate a migration in CoffeeScript using the same template as in this example. You can of course provide your own template in JavaScript.

    module.exports =
      requiresDowntime: FIXME # true or false

      up: (callback) ->
        // your migration goes here
        callback()

      down: (callback) ->
        // throw new Error('Irreversible migration.');
        callback()

      test: (callback) ->
        // your test goes here
        callback()

### Down Time Management

`requiresDowntime` is an option that intentionaly set to invalid value so that developer has to fix it. The flag is meant for **your own** deployment pipeline to be aware that there's a migration that requires server down time.

## Tasks

* `migrate:generate`
* `migrate:pending`
* `migrate:all`
* `migrate:one`
* `migrate:test`

### migrate:generate

Will create a migration using template in the file name with a `[timestamp]_[name].[ext]`

    $ grunt migrate:generate --name=rename_created_on_to_created_at

    Running "migrate:generate" task
    >> Created `./migrations/20131108211056037_rename_created_on_to_created_at.coffee`

    Done, without errors.

### migrate:pending

Prints out a list of pending migrations

    $ grunt migrate:pending

    Running "migrate:pending" task
    >> `20131108193444023_move_users` is pending (requires downtime)
    >> `20131108211056037_rename_created_on_to_created_at` is pending


### migrate:all

Runs all pending migrations.

    $ grunt migrate:all

    Running "migrate:all" task
    >> Running migration `20131108193444023_test1`
    >> Running migration `20131108211056037_rename_created_on_to_created_at`
    >> Finished migrations

    Done, without errors.

Running this again will do nothing because all migrations have been ran.

    $ grunt migrate:all

    Running "migrate:all" task
    >> Finished migrations

    Done, without errors.

### migrate:down

Runs down the last migration.

    $ grunt migrate:all

    Running "migrate:down" task
    >> Reversing migration `20131108211056037_rename_created_on_to_created_at`
    >> Migrated down

### migrate:one

Runs specific migration by name. If it was already executed before, will generate an error.

    $ grunt migrate:one --name=rename_created_on_to_created_at

    Running "migrate:one" task
    >> Running migration `20131108211056037_rename_created_on_to_created_at`
    >> Finished migrations

    Done, without errors.

### migrate:test

Runs specific migration by name via test runner. You should take care of using correct test databases. The template includes a proposed way of copying development database into test on every run.

    $ grunt migrate:test --name=rename_created_on_to_created_at

    Running "migrate:test" task
    >> Testing migration `20131108211056037_rename_created_on_to_created_at`
    >> Finished migrations

    Done, without errors.
